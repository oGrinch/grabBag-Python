# 📚 Python Grab Bag

[Prefer to read in Portuguese? 🇧🇷](README.ptbr.md)

Welcome to my Python Grab Bag — a place where I collect everything I’m learning about Python, from exercises to mini projects.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo exists so I can:

- **Get better at Python** by practicing with real examples and projects  
- **Keep everything organized** in one place as I learn  
- **Build a portfolio** of small projects to show what I can do  
- **Track my progress** as I grow as a developer

---

## 🚀 Running the Projects

To try out any of the projects here, just make sure you have **Python installed** — ideally the latest version.
This repository's projects are primarily developed using VS Code and are fully compatible with its environment.

## 🌱 What I’m Working On

Here are a few things I’ve built or am currently building:

- **Simple Interactive Calculator** – a basic calculator that handles arithmetic operations
- - [View code](projetos/calculadora_interativa/main.py)
- **Measurement Converter** - A simple Python program to convert between metric and imperial units.
- - [View code](projetos/conversor-medidas/main.py)
- **Simple Random Password Generator** - A basic project that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria.
- - [View code](projetos/gerador-senha/main.py)
