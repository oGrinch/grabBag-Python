# 📚 Python Grab Bag

[Prefer to read in Portuguese? 🇧🇷](README.ptbr.md)

Welcome to my Python Grab Bag — a place where I collect everything I’m learning about Python, from exercises to mini projects.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo exists so I can:

- **Get better at Python** by practicing with real examples and projects  
- **Keep everything organized** in one place as I learn  
- **Build a portfolio** of small projects to show what I can do  
- **Track my progress** as I grow as a developer

---

## 🚀 Running the Projects

To try out any of the projects here, just make sure you have **Python installed** — ideally the latest version.

---

## 🌱 What I’m Working On

Here are a few things I’ve built or am currently building:

- **Simple Interactive Calculator** – a basic calculator that handles arithmetic operations  
(More on the way!)

---

## 🤝 Contributing

This repo is mainly for personal learning, but I’m always open to ideas and feedback.  
If you spot something off or want to suggest an improvement, feel free to open an *issue* or *pull request*.
